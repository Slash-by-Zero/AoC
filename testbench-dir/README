Usage: ./testbench [options]

options := option [options]
option  := "--" key "=" value

Special restrictions:
	- Either day or path option must have a value!

Extra information:
	As an alternative you can also write the options in a testbench.conf file in the same folder as the testbench binary. 
	In wich case you can ignore the "--" and seperate options ith '\n'.
	
	This program was made for timing the solutions of AoC solution wich are present as executable programs,
	but is made to support timing of other stuff too.
	Folder setup should be <user>/<path>
	<user> can be a string if you want to compare different programs on the same input or . if you have no friends!
	
	As this program was made for AoC it supports the <day> and <year> options as an alternative to <path>,
	wich are extended to the path <year>/<day>/<day>.out, where
	<day> is a number between 1 and 25 (1 to 9 have leading 0s) or all wich will be expanded to the shell wildcard * and
	<year> the year of the AoC.

keys:
	day: Number 1 to 25 (No leading 0's) or all (No standard value)
	year: Number between 2015 and <last_aoc_problems> (Standard value = maximum year of range)
	user: predicate for path (shell wildcards allowed) (Standard value = .)
			(If the globbing of the user expands to multiple results the days will be seperated by hlines in the table)
	path: Path to the executable to be tested (shell wildards allowed)
	runs: Number of runs to be performed per program
	tablstyle: Determines the style of the result table! Options are (utf16 for boxdrawing characters, utf8 for standard retro boxdrawing with +-|= or 
			csv if the output should have standard csv format)
	time-limit: If this value is set to something other than 0 further tests will be skipped if the total has exceeded that time limit (int seconds)
	print-output: yes or no Determines if the outptus of each program should be printed to stdout. May still print discrepancies to stderr.
